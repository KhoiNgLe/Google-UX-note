# Foundation of User Experience: Week 1 

**Definition:** The user experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product. A product can be; physical product, like a video game controller or a bag of potato chips, or a technology product, like an app, website, or smartwatch. For a user to have a good experience, the product needs to be usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful

Case study example: Historically, ketchup came in a glass bottle. The user had to hit the bottom of the glass to make ketchup come out. Often, no ketchup or too much ketchup would come out of the bottle. Today, the ketchup bottle has been redesigned into a plastic squeezable bottle, which makes it easier to use and allows users to control how much ketchup comes out

## **The product development life cycle:**

Definition: The process used to take a product from an idea to reality 

### **5 stages:**

- **Brainstorm**: the team starts thinking of an idea for a product. Your team might already know the user problem that you want to solve when you begin the product development life cycle. If not, coming up with a list of user problems is a great place to start
- **Define**: The goal is to figure out the specifications for the product by answering questions like: Who is the product for? What will the product do? And, what features need to be included for the product to be successful?
- **Design:** UX designers develop the ideas for the product. Generally, UX designers start by drawing wireframes, ****
which are outlines or sketches of the product, then move on to creating prototypes, which are early models of a product that convey its functionality
- **Test:** The designs go through at least three phases of testing: internal tests within your company, reviews with stakeholders, and external tests with potential users
- **Launch:**
